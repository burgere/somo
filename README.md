Prototype for a social-emotional learning application for students K-8.

To run this app:

Clone this repository and navigate to the 'somo' directory in your command line. Run 'gulp dev' to build the application. In it's current stage, the app is buggy. If you run into any issues running it, contact me at burgere@sbcglobal.net.
